    <h1>WiMAX</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The advent of WiMAX, an acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, in the early 2000s marked a significant endeavor to revolutionize wireless communication. This technology emerged with the primary objective of delivering high-speed internet access over extensive distances.  Its fundamental design aimed to serve as a robust wireless alternative to traditional wired broadband services, particularly in regions where the deployment of physical infrastructure presented considerable challenges and costs. The initial focus was heavily directed towards underserved rural areas, where the economic and logistical hurdles of laying down cables were substantial.
    <br>
    <br>
    WiMAX offers coverage of up to 50 km and speeds of up to 75 Mbps. It provides flexible connectivity, working in both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) environments, making it ideal for Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). Line-of-Sight (LOS) is when the signal travels directly between antennas without any obstacles. This allows for higher speeds and longer distances because there is minimal interference. Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) is when the signal has to go through, around, or reflect off obstacles like buildings, trees, or terrain. This can cause some loss of speed and range but allows the signal to reach areas where direct visibility isn't possible.</p>
    <h2>Importance in Networking</h2>
    <p>WiMAX facilitates the extension of high-speed internet access to remote, rural, and underserved areas, ensuring reliable and fast communication. This advancement enhances digital inclusion, allowing communities to access online services more effectively.
    <br>
    <br>
    WiMAX enables users to maintain network connections while moving between different locations. This ensures continuous service across various networks, providing seamless connectivity for mobile users.
    <br>
    <br>
    The system is designed to expand and adapt easily to increasing demands or changing requirements without the need for significant reconfiguration. This flexibility makes WiMAX a future-proof solution for growing network needs.
    <br>
    <br>
    WiMAX supports Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) applications by providing high-speed data transmission over large areas. These networks connect multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) within the same geographic region and support various services, including internet access.
    <br>
    <br>
    WiMAX ensures seamless interoperability between different systems, allowing for smooth integration and collaboration. Additionally, it supports future technological advancements and network expansion, making it a scalable and sustainable solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Foundations and Working Principles</h2>
    <p>The operational framework of WiMAX is built upon the IEEE 802.16 family of standards, which meticulously define the protocols and procedures governing both the physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of the communication system. The initial groundwork for this standard began in 1998, with the WiMAX Forum subsequently established in 2001 to champion interoperability and facilitate the development of a robust ecosystem. The inaugural IEEE 802.16 standard, released in 2001, primarily targeted the 10–66 GHz frequency spectrum and was designed for fixed, line-of-sight (LOS) applications, mainly serving as a solution for point-to-point wireless links.
    <br>
    <br>
    A significant advancement came with the introduction of IEEE 802.16a (later revised as 802.16-2004), which broadened the standard to include the 2–11 GHz frequency range, thereby enabling non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operation. This amendment laid the foundation for the first generation of WiMAX solutions aimed at fixed broadband access, commonly referred to as Fixed WiMAX. The next pivotal step in the evolution of the standard was the ratification of IEEE 802.16e-2005, known as Mobile WiMAX. This amendment introduced crucial features such as support for mobility through seamless handover between base stations, the implementation of scalable Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (SOFDMA), the integration of advanced antenna diversity techniques like Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), and enhancements to improve signal penetration in indoor environments. These additions were instrumental in positioning WiMAX as a viable technology for mobile broadband services.
    <br>
    <br>
    To ensure seamless operation and interoperability across different equipment manufacturers, the WiMAX Forum defined specific system profiles, which represent carefully selected subsets of the comprehensive IEEE 802.16 standard. The fixed system profile, based on the IEEE 802.16d-2004 standard, utilizes Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a 256-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and was primarily designed for stationary users and point-to-multipoint network architectures. In contrast, the mobility system profile is built upon the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard and employs scalable OFDMA (SOFDMA) with adaptable FFT sizes. While Fixed WiMAX (802.16d) primarily catered to fixed and nomadic applications, Mobile WiMAX (802.16e) extended its support to encompass fixed, nomadic, portable, and fully mobile scenarios.
    <br>
    <br>
    WiMAX leverages several key technologies to achieve efficient and high-speed wireless transmission. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and its multi-user variant, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), are central to its operation, particularly in mobile versions. These techniques divide the available radio spectrum into numerous orthogonal subcarriers, allowing for parallel data transmission and mitigating the effects of frequency-selective fading. OFDMA further enhances this by enabling multiple users to simultaneously access network resources by allocating different subcarriers to each user. Additionally, WiMAX incorporates Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology by utilizing multiple antennas at both the transmitting base station and the receiving user device, which improves signal coverage, increases data capacity, and enhances resistance to signal fading. Adaptive modulation allows the system to dynamically adjust the modulation scheme and error correction coding based on prevailing channel conditions, while the design supports scalable bandwidths typically ranging from 1.25 MHz to 20 MHz, providing network operators with flexibility to tailor deployments based on available spectrum and capacity requirements. WiMAX also incorporates built-in Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms to prioritize voice and video traffic, boasting higher spectral efficiency than Wi-Fi and ensuring interoperability between different vendors' equipment.
    <br>
    <br>
    At the Physical Layer (PHY), WiMAX primarily utilizes OFDM and OFDMA, which divide the channel into many orthogonal subcarriers to make the system resilient to multipath interference and allow flexible allocation of bandwidth to multiple users. The introduction of Scalable OFDMA (SOFDMA) in the 802.16e standard further enables the system to adapt the number of subcarriers based on the available channel bandwidth. The system employs adaptive modulation schemes—including BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM—that adjust according to signal quality to balance data rate and robustness. Moreover, advanced antenna techniques such as MIMO and beamforming are incorporated to improve signal quality, range, and throughput. WiMAX is designed to operate in both licensed frequency bands (e.g., 2.3, 2.5, 3.5 GHz) and unlicensed bands (e.g., 5.8 GHz), with channel bandwidths that can flexibly range from 1.25 MHz to 28 MHz, and supports both Time Division Duplexing (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD), with mobile WiMAX primarily utilizing TDD.
    <br>
    <br>
    At the Media Access Control (MAC) Layer, WiMAX operates in a connection-oriented manner, establishing connections between the base station (BS) and subscriber station (SS) before data transfer takes place. This layer is designed with inherent QoS support, enabling the prioritization of various traffic types such as voice, video, and data through mechanisms like Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS) and Real-Time Polling Service (rtPS). A centralized scheduling mechanism is implemented whereby the base station controls both uplink and downlink access for subscriber stations, effectively avoiding collisions common in contention-based systems like Wi-Fi, which relies on CSMA/CA. Security is also a fundamental aspect of the MAC layer, with features including encryption (e.g., AES) and robust authentication protocols. The overall network architecture typically comprises Subscriber Stations (SS) or Mobile Stations (MS), Base Stations (BS), and a core network divided into the Access Service Network (ASN) and Connectivity Service Network (CSN), which together provide IP connectivity and interface with other networks.
    In certain scenarios, particularly in rural areas, WiMAX has offered a more cost-effective deployment option compared to laying wired infrastructure, making it a flexible and scalable solution for broadband access.

    <h2>Future of WiMAX</h2>
    <p> 
        WiMAX reached its peak usage between 2010 and 2011, when it expanded rapidly worldwide and was seen as a promising technology for high-speed internet. Many telecom companies invested in WiMAX, and organizations like the WiMAX Forum helped standardize and certify devices to support it.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, despite its early success, WiMAX started to lose popularity as mobile operators shifted their focus to LTE (Long-Term Evolution) technology. LTE became the preferred choice because it offered faster speeds, better efficiency, and worked well with existing mobile networks. While WiMAX was designed mainly for internet access, LTE proved to be more flexible and could support the growing demand for mobile broadband.
        <br>
        <br>
        At first, big companies like Intel, Clearwire, and Sprint strongly supported WiMAX. Some countries, such as Russia, India, and parts of Latin America, adopted WiMAX to provide internet in areas where traditional broadband was not available. However, a major problem was that most smartphone manufacturers did not support WiMAX, and it was not compatible with many existing networks, which made it harder to expand.
        <br>
        <br>    
        By the mid-2010s, WiMAX started to decline as companies switched to LTE. Some companies that had invested in WiMAX, like Clearwire, shut down their networks or upgraded them to LTE. In 2015, even the WiMAX Forum changed its focus to other uses, recognizing that WiMAX was no longer competitive in mobile internet services.
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, the future of WiMAX is uncertain. Newer technologies like 4G LTE and 5G have replaced it in most places. While WiMAX was once an exciting solution for high-speed internet, its use has decreased because newer networks are faster, more efficient, and more widely supported. However, WiMAX is still used in some specific areas, such as rural internet services, transportation, and industrial communication. Some companies continue to rely on it where LTE is not fully available or where building fiber-optic networks is too expensive.
        <br>
        <br>
        As technology continues to evolve, WiMAX may still have some uses in certain industries, but its mainstream use will likely continue to fade, becoming a part of telecom history.
